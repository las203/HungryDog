How to build a game for pitpets in 5 easy steps:

1) Import Pitpex (both the Pitpex folder and the WebGLTemplates)

2) Make your game! Remember to update the score by calling Pitpex.SetScore(double) or Pitpex.AddScore(double);

3) When the player loses, call Pitpex.GameOver()

4) Add your game's scenes to the build settings. Pitpex will load the scene with index 0 automatically!

5) Run Pitpex > Build Pitpets Game

And you're done!
